Accretion of gas and black hole mergers play a fundamental role in\\ndetermining the two parameters defining a black hole: mass and spin. I briefly\\nreview here some of the physical processes that are conducive to the evolution\\nof the massive black hole population. I'll discuss black hole formation\\nprocesses that are likely to place at early cosmic epochs, and how massive\\nblack hole evolve in a hierarchical Universe. The mass of the black holes that\\nwe detect today in nearby galaxy has mostly been accumulated by accretion of\\ngas. While black hole--black hole mergers do not contribute substantially to\\nthe final mass of massive black holes, they influence the occupancy of galaxy\\ncenters by black hole, owing to the chance of merging black holes being kicked\\nfrom their dwellings due to the gravitational recoil. Similarly, accretion\\nleaves a deeper imprint on the distribution of black hole spins than black hole\\nmergers do. The differences in accretion histories for black holes hosted in\\nelliptical or disc galaxies may reflect on different spin distributions.\\n        **PDF Summary:** Massive black holes (MBHs) play a crucial role in galaxy evolution. Their formation involves early cosmic processes and mergers. Accretion of gas and mergers influence their mass and spin distribution. Accretion dominates mass accumulation, while mergers affect the occupancy of galaxy centers. Differences in accretion histories between elliptical and disc galaxies may lead to distinct spin distributions. In a hierarchical Universe, MBHs form through mergers and co-evolve with their host galaxies. Gas-poor systems may experience three-body interactions with stars during the sub-parsec binary evolution phase.\\n        **PDF Link:** http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1722v2\\n        ...\",\n",

       " '**Wikipedia - Binary black hole**:\\nA binary black hole (BBH), or black hole binary, is a system consisting of two black holes in close orbit around each other. Like black holes themselves, binary black holes are often divided into binary stellar black holes, formed either as remnants of high-mass binary star systems or by dynamic processes and mutual capture; and binary supermassive black holes, believed to be a result of galactic mergers.\\nFor many years, proving the existence of binary black holes was made difficult because of the nature of black holes themselves and the limited means of detection available. However, in the event that a pair of black holes were to merge, an immense amount of energy should be given off as gravitational waves, with distinctive waveforms that can be calculated using general relativity. Therefore, during the late 20th and early 21st century, binary black holes became of great interest scientifically as a potential source of such waves and a means by which gravitational waves could be proven to exist. Binary black hole mergers would be one of the strongest known sources of gravitational waves in the universe, and thus offer a good chance of directly detecting such waves. As the orbiting black holes give off these waves, the orbit decays, and the orbital period decreases. This stage is called binary black hole inspiral. The black holes will merge once they are close enough. Once merged, the single hole settles down to a stable form, via a stage called ringdown, where any distortion in the shape is dissipated as more gravitational waves. In the final fraction of a second the black holes can reach extremely high velocity, and the gravitational wave amplitude reaches its peak.\\nThe existence of stellar-mass binary black holes (and gravitational waves themselves) was finally confirmed when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected GW150914 (detected September 2015, announced February 2016), a distinctive gravitational wave signature of two merging...',\n",
       " '**Wikipedia - Black hole**:\\nA black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. Albert Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, but has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.\\nObjects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape was first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterise a black hole. Due to his influential research, the Schwarzschild metric is named after him. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of \"black hole\" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.\\nBlack holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar ...']"
